                “You don’t have to believe anything. These are tools for inner wellbeing, like a technology for your body and mind. You simply practice and see what happens within you — no belief or conversion is required.”

                “Most foundational programs are structured so that even people with busy schedules can do them. After that, the daily practices usually take a limited amount of time each day, like any other health routine — but you can experience benefit even from that small investment of time.”

              You do not need to answer everything in depth. It is enough to share what you know clearly, and direct them to official Isha pages or volunteers when needed.
